Got it üëç ‚Äî let‚Äôs strip away all code and keep only the functional + technical requirements for the blockchain-only POC. This will give you a checklist of what you need to deploy and test without backend/frontend.

üìå Blockchain-only POC: Functional & Technical Requirements

üéØ Objectives
	‚Ä¢	Be able to deploy simple contracts to a testnet or local node.
	‚Ä¢	Test the core flows:
	1.	Register a user(user ‚Üí chain).
	2.	Verify/accept/reject a submission (verifier ‚Üí chain).
	3.	Fund bounty pools in stablecoin (brand ‚Üí chain).
	4.	Claim payout in stablecoin (user ‚Üí chain).
	‚Ä¢	Keep everything minimal: minimal python scripts to test out setup of environment and functionalities.

üß© Smart Contract Components

1. Submission Registry
	‚Ä¢	Purpose: Track submissions on-chain with minimal data.
	‚Ä¢	Functions:
	‚Ä¢	registerSubmission(contentHash, uri, mime) ‚Üí record submission & emit event.
	‚Ä¢	getSubmission(id) ‚Üí read details.
	‚Ä¢	Events: SubmissionRegistered(id, submitter, contentHash, uri, mime, timestamp).
	‚Ä¢	Notes: No file storage, just hash/URI references.

‚∏ª

2. Verification Manager
	‚Ä¢	Purpose: Allow designated verifiers to accept/reject submissions.
	‚Ä¢	Functions:
	‚Ä¢	setVerification(submissionId, accepted, reasonCode) ‚Üí record decision.
	‚Ä¢	getVerification(submissionId) ‚Üí read decision.
	‚Ä¢	Roles:
	‚Ä¢	VERIFIER_ROLE (brands/reviewers).
	‚Ä¢	ADMIN_ROLE (setup roles).
	‚Ä¢	Events: SubmissionVerified(submissionId, verifier, accepted, reasonCode, timestamp).
	‚Ä¢	Notes: Could later integrate with EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service).

‚∏ª

3. Bounty Pool
	‚Ä¢	Purpose: Manage bounty funds and payouts in stablecoin.
	‚Ä¢	Functions:
	‚Ä¢	fundBounty(bountyId, amount) ‚Üí brand funds pool (requires ERC-20 approve).
	‚Ä¢	markClaimable(submissionId, recipient, amount) ‚Üí mark accepted submissions as claimable.
	‚Ä¢	claim(submissionId, recipient) ‚Üí user claims payout.
	‚Ä¢	Events:
	‚Ä¢	BountyFunded(bountyId, amount, funder)
	‚Ä¢	ClaimableSet(submissionId, recipient, amount)
	‚Ä¢	PayoutClaimed(submissionId, recipient, amount)
	‚Ä¢	Notes: Owner/admin sets claimable amounts for simplicity in POC.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Requirements

Environment
	‚Ä¢	Blockchain: EVM-compatible (Ethereum testnets, Base Sepolia, Optimism Sepolia, Polygon Amoy, Arbitrum Sepolia).
	‚Ä¢	Contracts: Solidity (‚â•0.8.18), OpenZeppelin libraries for AccessControl, Ownable, ERC-20 interface.
	‚Ä¢	Frameworks: Hardhat (JS/TS) or Brownie (Python) for compiling, deploying, and testing.
	‚Ä¢	Token: Testnet stablecoin (e.g. USDC/USDT faucet address) OR a mock ERC-20 for local testing.

Config & Setup
	‚Ä¢	.env variables: RPC URL, private key, stablecoin address.
	‚Ä¢	Deployment script that outputs all contract addresses (for later reference).
	‚Ä¢	Optional local blockchain for dry-run testing (Hardhat node, Ganache, or Anvil).

Interaction
	‚Ä¢	Ability to call contract functions via:
	‚Ä¢	Hardhat CLI / scripts (JS/TS).
	‚Ä¢	Web3.py (Python scripting).
	‚Ä¢	Ability to listen for events (Submissions, Verifications, Payouts).

Security / Ops (POC level)
	‚Ä¢	Contract ownership with a single deployer account (later ‚Üí multisig Safe).
	‚Ä¢	Use AccessControl for verifier role.
	‚Ä¢	Minimal checks:
	‚Ä¢	Prevent double claims.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure fundBounty uses transferFrom with prior approval.
	‚Ä¢	Keep contracts upgrade-minimal (plain deploy, no proxy for POC).

‚∏ª

‚úÖ POC Test Flow (Happy Path)
	1.	Brand funds bounty
	‚Ä¢	Approves stablecoin.
	‚Ä¢	Calls fundBounty(bountyId, amount).
	2.	User submits
	‚Ä¢	Uploads file off-chain (manual step for now).
	‚Ä¢	Computes content hash.
	‚Ä¢	Calls registerSubmission(contentHash, uri, mime).
	3.	Verifier reviews
	‚Ä¢	Calls setVerification(submissionId, accepted=true, reasonCode=0).
	‚Ä¢	Admin marks payout via markClaimable(submissionId, recipient, amount).
	4.	User claims payout
	‚Ä¢	Calls claim(submissionId, wallet).
	‚Ä¢	Stablecoin transferred to user.

‚∏ª

üìä Deliverables for POC
	‚Ä¢	Deployed contracts on a testnet with addresses.
	‚Ä¢	Checklist of calls: Submission ‚Üí Verification ‚Üí Fund ‚Üí Claim.
	‚Ä¢	Event logs:
	‚Ä¢	SubmissionRegistered
	‚Ä¢	SubmissionVerified
	‚Ä¢	BountyFunded
	‚Ä¢	ClaimableSet
	‚Ä¢	PayoutClaimed
	‚Ä¢	Manual test run:
	‚Ä¢	Register at least one submission.
	‚Ä¢	Verify/accept it.
	‚Ä¢	Fund bounty pool and claim payout.

üëâ This setup lets you learn the environment quickly: deploy, call, and track events ‚Äî without backend or frontend.

Would you like me to make a step-by-step ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù test script plan (e.g., exact sequence of contract calls with example parameters) so you can walk through one submission-to-payout cycle on a local node?
